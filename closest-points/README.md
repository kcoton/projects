# Closest Points Finder
- Uses a textfile list of points (x, y, z values + class belonging to) and compares it to the user inputted point.
- User inputted point has an x, y, and z value. User is also required to input how many closest points they would like as a result.
- Point from user is compared to find specified number of points from the input file that have the shortest distance.
- Class of the user input is assigned based on the class of the closest points found.
